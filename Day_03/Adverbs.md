    Examples: however, therefore, moreover, nevertheless, meanwhile

    Sentence: It was raining; however, we still went hiking.


## 📝 Adverb Formation

###  From Adjectives

Many adverbs are formed by adding -ly to adjectives:

    Adjective → Adverb

        quick → quickly

        happy → happily

        careful → carefully

        easy → easily


###  Irregular Adverbs

Some adverbs have irregular forms:

    good → well

    fast → fast

    hard → hard

    early → early

> No Change from Adjective

Some words function as both adjectives and adverbs:

    early, late, hard, fast, high, low, right, wrong


## 📍 Adverb Placement

### General Rules

> Adverbs of manner usually come after the verb:

        She sings beautifully.

> Adverbs of frequency typically come before the main verb:

        I always drink coffee in the morning.

        Exception: After the verb "to be"

            He is always late.

> Adverbs of time can come at the beginning or end of a sentence:

        Yesterday, we went shopping.

        We went shopping yesterday.

> Adverbs of place usually come after the verb or verb phrase:

        They looked everywhere.


### Multiple Adverbs Order

When using multiple adverbs, the typical order is:

    Manner → Place → Time

    She worked diligently (manner) at her desk (place) all day (time).


## 🔄 Degrees of Comparison

Like adjectives, most adverbs have three degrees:

|Degree	|Formation	|Example|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Positive|	Base form	|fast, quickly|
|Comparative|	Add *-er* or more	|faster, more quickly|
|Superlative	|Add -est or most	|fastest, most quickly|

> Rules:

    One-syllable adverbs: add -er/-est (fast → faster → fastest)

    Adverbs ending in *-ly*: use more/most (quickly → more quickly → most quickly)

    Irregular forms: well → better → best, badly → worse → worst


## 🔗 Relationship with Other Parts of Speech

> Adverbs vs. Adjectives
|Adverb|	Adjective|
|:---:|:---:|
|Modifies verbs, adjectives, other adverbs|	Modifies nouns|
|Answers: how, when, where, to what extent	|Answers: what kind, which one, how many|
|Example: She is a quick learner. (adj)|	Example: She learns quickly. (adv)|

### Common Confusions

> Good vs. Well

        Good → adjective (She is a good singer)

        Well → adverb (She sings well)

> Real vs. Really

        Real → adjective (That's a real diamond)

        Really → adverb (That's really expensive)


## 📚 Special Adverb Categories

### Focusing Adverbs

> Draw attention to one part of a sentence

    Examples: only, just, even, especially, particularly

    Sentence: I want only the best.

> Viewpoint Adverbs

Express the speaker's perspective

    Examples: personally, frankly, honestly, technically

    Sentence: Frankly, I don't agree with you.

    Examples: wisely, foolishly, rightly, wrongly

    Sentence: He wisely invested his money.


### 💡 Usage Tips

> Do's:

    Use adverbs to add precision and detail to your writing

    Place adverbs as close as possible to the word they modify

    Use conjunctive adverbs to create smooth transitions between ideas

    Vary your adverb usage for more interesting writing

> Don'ts:

    Don't use adverbs when the verb is strong enough on its own

        Instead of "She whispered quietly" → "She whispered"

    Avoid redundant combinations

        Instead of "completely finish" → "finish"

    Don't split infinitives unless necessary for clarity or emphasis


## 🎯 Common Adverb Mistakes to Avoid

> Double negatives:

        ❌ "I don't have no money"

        ✅ "I don't have any money" or "I have no money"

> Adjective/adverb confusion:

        ❌ "She drives good"

        ✅ "She drives well"

> Misplaced modifiers:

        ❌ "I almost drove the kids to school every day"

        ✅ "I drove the kids to school almost every day"


### 📖 Practice Patterns

> Subject + Verb + Adverb of Manner

        He speaks clearly.

        She often travels.
