## Adjective Order in Sentences

When multiple adjectives describe a noun, they typically follow this order:

    Quantity or number

    Quality or opinion

    Size

    Age

    Shape

    Color

    Proper adjective (nationality, origin)

    Purpose or qualifier


> Example: Three beautiful large old round red Italian wooden dining tables

## 🎯 Quick Tips

    Verbs show action or state; adjectives describe

    Most adjectives come before nouns (a red car)

    Adjectives can follow linking verbs (The sky is blue)

    Regular verbs add "-ed" for past tense; many common verbs are irregular

    Use comparative adjectives for two items, superlative for three or more
